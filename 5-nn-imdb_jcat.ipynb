       "  xxmaj overall , this is second - rate action trash . xxmaj there are countless better films to see , and if you really want to see this one , watch xxmaj judgement xxmaj night , which is practically a carbon copy but has better acting and a better script . xxmaj the only thing that made this at all worth watching was a decent hand on the camera - the cinematography was almost refreshing , which comes close to making up for the horrible film itself - but not quite . 4 / 10 .,  xxwrep 18 xxbos xxmaj first of all i hate those moronic rappers , who could'nt act if they had a gun pressed against their foreheads . xxmaj all they do is curse and shoot each other and acting like xxunk version of gangsters . \n",

       "  xxmaj the movie does n't take more than five minutes to explain what is going on before we 're already at the warehouse xxmaj there is not a single sympathetic character in this movie , except for the homeless guy , who is also the only one with half a brain . \n",

       "  xxmaj bill xxmaj paxton and xxmaj william xxmaj sadler are both hill billies and xxmaj xxunk character is just as much a villain as the gangsters . i did'nt like him right from the start . \n",

       "  xxmaj the movie is filled with pointless violence and xxmaj walter xxmaj hills specialty : people falling through windows with glass flying everywhere . xxmaj there is pretty much no plot and it is a big problem when you root for no - one . xxmaj everybody dies , except from xxmaj paxton and the homeless guy and everybody get what they deserve . \n",

       "  xxmaj my acting in 8th grade was more convincing than the seasoned actors who appear in this film ( xxmaj lorenzo xxmaj lamas , xxmaj stephen xxmaj bauer ) . xxmaj line delivery is very fake , and the words themselves are poorly scripted . xxmaj the opening words come from a man checking out his gun 's scope : \" xxmaj boom . xxmaj dead bad guys . \" xxmaj yes , that 's pure genius at work . xxmaj the only conversation with any depth has two main characters explaining their histories . xxmaj but it , too , seems unnatural and a poor attempt to provide character background and to fill time . xxmaj we did n't need to know anything about their histories , so why bore us with it ? xxmaj and if you think the conversations are bad , you ai n't seen nothing yet . \n",

       "  xxmaj also known under the slightly different tile xxmaj airport 1977 this second sequel to the smash - hit disaster thriller xxmaj airport ( 1970 ) was directed by xxmaj jerry xxmaj jameson & while once again like it 's predecessors i ca n't say xxmaj airport ' 77 is any sort of forgotten classic it is entertaining although not necessarily for the right reasons . xxmaj out of the three xxmaj airport films i have seen so far i actually liked this one the best , just . xxmaj it has my favourite plot of the three with a nice mid - air hi - jacking & then the crashing ( did n't he see the oil rig ? ) & sinking of the 747 ( maybe the makers were trying to cross the original xxmaj airport with another popular disaster flick of the period xxmaj the xxmaj poseidon xxmaj adventure ( 1972 ) ) & submerged is where it stays until the end with a stark dilemma facing those trapped inside , either suffocate when the air runs out or drown as the 747 floods or if any of the doors are opened & it 's a decent idea that could have made for a great little disaster flick but bad unsympathetic character 's , dull dialogue , lethargic set - pieces & a real lack of danger or suspense or tension means this is a missed opportunity . xxmaj while the rather sluggish plot keeps one entertained for 108 odd minutes not that much happens after the plane sinks & there 's not as much urgency as i thought there should have been . xxmaj even when the xxmaj navy become involved things do n't pick up that much with a few shots of huge ships & helicopters flying about but there 's just something lacking here . xxmaj george xxmaj kennedy as the jinxed airline worker xxmaj joe xxmaj patroni is back but only gets a couple of scenes & barely even says anything preferring to just look worried in the background . \n",

       "  xxmaj the home video & theatrical version of xxmaj airport ' 77 run 108 minutes while the xxup us xxup tv versions add an extra hour of footage including a new opening credits sequence , many more scenes with xxmaj george xxmaj kennedy as xxmaj patroni , flashbacks to flesh out character 's , longer rescue scenes & the discovery or another couple of dead bodies including the navigator . xxmaj while i would like to see this extra footage i am not sure i could sit through a near three hour cut of xxmaj airport ' 77 . xxmaj as expected the film has dated badly with horrible fashions & interior design choices , i will say no more other than the toy plane model effects are n't great either . xxmaj along with the other two xxmaj airport sequels this takes pride of place in the xxmaj razzie xxmaj award 's xxmaj hall of xxmaj shame although i can think of lots of worse films than this so i reckon that 's a little harsh . xxmaj the action scenes are a little dull unfortunately , the pace is slow & not much excitement or tension is generated which is a shame as i reckon this could have been a pretty good film if made properly . \n",

       "  xxmaj airport ' 77 is the most disaster orientated of the three xxmaj airport films so far & i liked the ideas behind it even if they were a bit silly , the production & bland direction does n't help though & a film about a sunken plane just should n't be this boring or lethargic . xxmaj followed by xxmaj the xxmaj concorde ... xxmaj airport ' 79 ( 1979 ) .,xxbos xxmaj this film lacked something i could n't put my finger on at first : charisma on the part of the leading actress . xxmaj this inevitably translated to lack of chemistry when she shared the screen with her leading man . xxmaj even the romantic scenes came across as being merely the actors at play . xxmaj it could very well have been the director who miscalculated what he needed from the actors . i just do n't know . \n",

       "  i was disappointed in this movie . xxmaj but , do n't forget it was nominated for an xxmaj oscar , so judge for yourself .,xxbos xxmaj sorry everyone , , , i know this is supposed to be an \" art \" film , , but wow , they should have handed out guns at the screening so people could blow their brains out and not watch . xxmaj although the scene design and photographic direction was excellent , this story is too painful to watch . xxmaj the absence of a sound track was brutal . xxmaj the l xxrep 4 o xxrep 5 n g shots were too long . xxmaj how long can you watch two people just sitting there and talking ? xxmaj especially when the dialogue is two people complaining . i really had a hard time just getting through this film . xxmaj the performances were excellent , but how much of that dark , sombre , uninspired , stuff can you take ? xxmaj the only thing i liked was xxmaj maureen xxmaj stapleton and her red dress and dancing scene . xxmaj otherwise this was a ripoff of xxmaj bergman . xxmaj and i 'm no fan f his either . i think anyone who says they enjoyed 1 1 / 2 hours of this is , , well , lying .,xxbos xxmaj when i was little my parents took me along to the theater to see xxmaj interiors . xxmaj it was one of many movies i watched with my parents , but this was the only one we walked out of . xxmaj since then i had never seen xxmaj interiors until just recently , and i could have lived out the rest of my life without it . xxmaj what a pretentious , ponderous , and painfully boring piece of 70 's wine and cheese tripe . xxmaj woody xxmaj allen is one of my favorite directors but xxmaj interiors is by far the worst piece of crap of his career . xxmaj in the unmistakable style of xxmaj ingmar xxmaj berman , xxmaj allen gives us a dark , angular , muted , insight in to the lives of a family wrought by the psychological damage caused by divorce , estrangement , career , love , non - love , xxunk , whatever . xxmaj the film , intentionally , has no comic relief , no music , and is drenched in shadowy pathos . xxmaj this film style can be best defined as expressionist in nature , using an improvisational method of dialogue to illicit a \" more pronounced depth of meaning and truth \" . xxmaj but xxmaj woody xxmaj allen is no xxmaj ingmar xxmaj bergman . xxmaj the film is painfully slow and dull . xxmaj but beyond that , i simply had no connection with or sympathy for any of the characters . xxmaj instead i felt only contempt for this parade of shuffling , whining , nicotine stained , martyrs in a perpetual quest for identity . xxmaj amid a backdrop of cosmopolitan affluence and baked xxmaj brie intelligentsia the story looms like a fart in the room . xxmaj everyone speaks in affected platitudes and elevated language between cigarettes . xxmaj everyone is \" lost \" and \" struggling \" , desperate to find direction or understanding or whatever and it just goes on and on to the point where you just want to slap all of them . xxmaj it 's never about resolution , it 's only about interminable introspective babble . xxmaj it is nothing more than a psychological drama taken to an extreme beyond the audience 's ability to connect . xxmaj woody xxmaj allen chose to make characters so immersed in themselves we feel left out . xxmaj and for that reason i found this movie painfully self indulgent and spiritually draining . i see what he was going for but his insistence on promoting his message through xxmaj prozac prose and distorted film techniques jettisons it past the point of relevance . i highly recommend this one if you 're feeling a little too happy and need something to remind you of death . xxmaj otherwise , let 's just pretend this film never happened .\n",
