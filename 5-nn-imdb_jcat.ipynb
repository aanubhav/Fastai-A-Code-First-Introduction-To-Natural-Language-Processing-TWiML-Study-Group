       "  i was disappointed in this movie . xxmaj but , do n't forget it was nominated for an xxmaj oscar , so judge for yourself .,xxbos xxmaj sorry everyone , , , i know this is supposed to be an \" art \" film , , but wow , they should have handed out guns at the screening so people could blow their brains out and not watch . xxmaj although the scene design and photographic direction was excellent , this story is too painful to watch . xxmaj the absence of a sound track was brutal . xxmaj the l xxrep 4 o xxrep 5 n g shots were too long . xxmaj how long can you watch two people just sitting there and talking ? xxmaj especially when the dialogue is two people complaining . i really had a hard time just getting through this film . xxmaj the performances were excellent , but how much of that dark , sombre , uninspired , stuff can you take ? xxmaj the only thing i liked was xxmaj maureen xxmaj stapleton and her red dress and dancing scene . xxmaj otherwise this was a ripoff of xxmaj bergman . xxmaj and i 'm no fan f his either . i think anyone who says they enjoyed 1 1 / 2 hours of this is , , well , lying .,xxbos xxmaj when i was little my parents took me along to the theater to see xxmaj interiors . xxmaj it was one of many movies i watched with my parents , but this was the only one we walked out of . xxmaj since then i had never seen xxmaj interiors until just recently , and i could have lived out the rest of my life without it . xxmaj what a pretentious , ponderous , and painfully boring piece of 70 's wine and cheese tripe . xxmaj woody xxmaj allen is one of my favorite directors but xxmaj interiors is by far the worst piece of crap of his career . xxmaj in the unmistakable style of xxmaj ingmar xxmaj berman , xxmaj allen gives us a dark , angular , muted , insight in to the lives of a family wrought by the psychological damage caused by divorce , estrangement , career , love , non - love , xxunk , whatever . xxmaj the film , intentionally , has no comic relief , no music , and is drenched in shadowy pathos . xxmaj this film style can be best defined as expressionist in nature , using an improvisational method of dialogue to illicit a \" more pronounced depth of meaning and truth \" . xxmaj but xxmaj woody xxmaj allen is no xxmaj ingmar xxmaj bergman . xxmaj the film is painfully slow and dull . xxmaj but beyond that , i simply had no connection with or sympathy for any of the characters . xxmaj instead i felt only contempt for this parade of shuffling , whining , nicotine stained , martyrs in a perpetual quest for identity . xxmaj amid a backdrop of cosmopolitan affluence and baked xxmaj brie intelligentsia the story looms like a fart in the room . xxmaj everyone speaks in affected platitudes and elevated language between cigarettes . xxmaj everyone is \" lost \" and \" struggling \" , desperate to find direction or understanding or whatever and it just goes on and on to the point where you just want to slap all of them . xxmaj it 's never about resolution , it 's only about interminable introspective babble . xxmaj it is nothing more than a psychological drama taken to an extreme beyond the audience 's ability to connect . xxmaj woody xxmaj allen chose to make characters so immersed in themselves we feel left out . xxmaj and for that reason i found this movie painfully self indulgent and spiritually draining . i see what he was going for but his insistence on promoting his message through xxmaj prozac prose and distorted film techniques jettisons it past the point of relevance . i highly recommend this one if you 're feeling a little too happy and need something to remind you of death . xxmaj otherwise , let 's just pretend this film never happened .\n",

       "xxbos xxmaj once again xxmaj mr. xxmaj costner has dragged out a movie for far longer than necessary . xxmaj aside from the terrific sea rescue sequences , of which there are very few i just did not care about any of the characters . xxmaj most of us have ghosts in the closet , and xxmaj costner 's character are realized early on , and then forgotten until much later , by which time i did not care . xxmaj the character we should really care about is a very cocky , overconfident xxmaj ashton xxmaj kutcher . xxmaj the problem is he comes off as kid who thinks he 's better than anyone else around him and shows no signs of a cluttered closet . xxmaj his only obstacle appears to be winning over xxmaj costner . xxmaj finally when we are well past the half way point of this stinker , xxmaj costner tells us all about xxmaj kutcher 's ghosts . xxmaj we are told why xxmaj kutcher is driven to be the best with no prior inkling or foreshadowing . xxmaj no magic here , it was all i could do to keep from turning it off an hour in .,xxbos xxmaj this is an example of why the majority of action films are the same . xxmaj generic and boring , there 's really nothing worth watching here . a complete waste of the then barely - tapped talents of xxmaj ice - t and xxmaj ice xxmaj cube , who 've each proven many times over that they are capable of acting , and acting well . xxmaj do n't bother with this one , go see xxmaj new xxmaj jack xxmaj city , xxmaj ricochet or watch xxmaj new xxmaj york xxmaj undercover for xxmaj ice - t , or xxmaj boyz n the xxmaj hood , xxmaj higher xxmaj learning or xxmaj friday for xxmaj ice xxmaj cube and see the real deal . xxmaj ice - t 's horribly cliched dialogue alone makes this film grate at the teeth , and i 'm still wondering what the heck xxmaj bill xxmaj paxton was doing in this film ? xxmaj and why the heck does he always play the exact same character ? xxmaj from xxmaj aliens onward , every film i 've seen with xxmaj bill xxmaj paxton has him playing the exact same irritating character , and at least in xxmaj aliens his character died , which made it somewhat gratifying ... \n",
