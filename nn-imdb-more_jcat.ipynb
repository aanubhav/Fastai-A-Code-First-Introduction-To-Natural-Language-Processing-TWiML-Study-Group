       "  xxmaj let me start this with a lesson : do n't lend a movie to your friend before you 've seen it , especially if you are supposed to be reviewing it for the internet 's finest horror movie site . xxmaj it took me almost a year to get this film back , and the person who borrowed it still had not watched it ( though we ended up seeing it together ) . xxmaj and a second , more important , lesson : when you do watch this , keep your expectations as low as humanly possible . xxmaj because this film ranks among the worst i 've ever seen . \n",
       " \n",
       "  xxmaj my acting in 8th grade was more convincing than the seasoned actors who appear in this film ( xxmaj lorenzo xxmaj lamas , xxmaj stephen xxmaj bauer ) . xxmaj line delivery is very fake , and the words themselves are poorly scripted . xxmaj the opening words come from a man checking out his gun 's scope : \" xxmaj boom . xxmaj dead bad guys . \" xxmaj yes , that 's pure genius at work . xxmaj the only conversation with any depth has two main characters explaining their histories . xxmaj but it , too , seems unnatural and a poor attempt to provide character background and to fill time . xxmaj we did n't need to know anything about their histories , so why bore us with it ? xxmaj and if you think the conversations are bad , you ai n't seen nothing yet . \n",
       " \n",
       "  xxmaj the lighting is atrocious . i generally do n't notice lighting , but my friend ( a former film school student ) was practically vomiting in rage at the way more often than not shadows fell on the actors ' faces and the light would be in the background , focused on nothing in particular . xxmaj most lighting looks like a spotlight in a dim room , and many of the scenes involve a deep , subterranean cavern -- which you 'd then expect to be poorly lit , but had lights coming from all sorts of random angles . xxmaj do n't ask me why . \n",
       " \n",
       "  xxmaj the plot was pretty bad . xxmaj some films can take the idea of military men chasing a terrorist and make a convincing film out of it . xxmaj cat and mouse stories are riveting . xxmaj well , not here . xxmaj the terrorist is really not even part of the story , just an excuse to go to the island . xxmaj and the raptors ? xxmaj and the allosaurus ? xxmaj sure , they came from the plutonium that soaked into the ground . xxmaj but if that makes sense to you , please explain it to me because i have no clue how radiation brings dinosaurs back from millions of years of extinction . \n",
       " \n",
       "  xxmaj by far the worst part of \" xxmaj raptor xxmaj island \" is the animation of the raptors . xxmaj that 's right -- the selling point of the film is the worst aspect . xxmaj the animation is n't just bad , it 's subpar . i ca n't even express the hilarity of cartoons this cheesy . xxmaj and when they get shot ? xxmaj red splats like one would see in an old video game . xxmaj even the airplane , helicopter and xxmaj navy ship are cartoons ... how hard is it to get a model plane ? xxmaj please do n't see \" xxmaj raptor xxmaj island \" unless you need a good laugh or want to get sickeningly drunk . xxmaj sure , you probably want to see it before you see \" xxmaj raptor xxmaj island 2 \" ( which seems to be getting better reviews ) . xxmaj but just avoiding it entirely is your best bet . xxmaj the closest thing i can compare it to is \" xxmaj pinata : xxmaj survival xxmaj island \" , and unfortunately this film makes the pinata look good by comparison . xxmaj you have been warned .,xxbos xxmaj this is one creepy underrated xxmaj gem with chilling performances and a fantastic xxunk xxmaj all the characters are great , and the story was awesome , plus i thought the ending was really xxunk xxmaj the plot was great , and it never bored me , plus while the child actors were bad , they gave me the xxunk xxmaj this happened to be on the space channel a while ago , so i decided to check it out and tape it , i read some good reviews from fellow horror fans , i must say i agree with them , it 's very creepy , and suspenseful , plus xxmaj strother xxmaj martin , was fantastic in his role , as the xxmaj satan worshiper . xxmaj it has tons of creepy atmosphere , and it keeps you guessing throughout , plus all the characters were very likable , and you really start to root for xxmaj ben and his xxunk xxmaj it has plenty of disturbing moments , and the film really shocked me at times , plus , it 's extremely well made on a low xxunk xxmaj this is one creepy underrated gem , with chilling performances and a fantastic finale ! , i highly recommend this one!. xxmaj the xxmaj direction is very good!. xxmaj bernard mceveety does a very good job here , with great camera work , creating a lot of creepy atmosphere , and keeping the film at a very fast pace!. xxmaj ther is a little bit of blood and gore . xxmaj we get a severed leg , lots of bloody corpses , bloody slit throat , slicing and dicing , decapitation , and an impaling . xxmaj the xxmaj acting is xxunk xxmaj strother xxmaj martin is fantastic here ! as the xxmaj satan worshiper , he is extremely creepy , very convincing , was quite chilling , was extremely intense , seemed to be enjoying himself , and just did a fantastic job xxunk xxmaj charles xxmaj bateman is great as the xxmaj dad , he was very caring , very likable , and gave a good show ! , i liked him lots . xxup l.q. xxmaj jones is awesome as the xxmaj sheriff , he was funny , on top of things , looked very young , had a cool character , and just did an awesome job xxunk xxmaj ahna xxmaj capri is good as the girlfriend and did what she had to do pretty well . xxmaj charles xxmaj robinson overacted to the extreme as the xxmaj priest and did n't convince me one bit ! , and that laugh of his was especially bad . xxmaj geri xxmaj reischl is actually decent as the daughter , she was somewhat likable , and only got on my nerves a couple times , i rather liked her . xxmaj alvy xxmaj moore was goofy , but very likable in his role as xxmaj tobey i dug him!. xxmaj rest of the cast do good . xxmaj overall i highly recommend it!. * * * 1 / 2 out of 5,xxbos xxmaj aside from the gross factual inaccuracies of this movie ( ie king xxmaj richard having a son and that son replacing xxmaj john on the throne ) this movie was a sweet love tale full of adventure . i 'm sure that this movie will appeal to the younger generation of girls and boys .,xxbos xxmaj the special effects again are superb but this is xxmaj finding xxmaj nemo in reverse i.e the parents get taken away and xxmaj pi ( xxmaj nemo ) is left behind , if you have n't seen xxmaj finding xxmaj nemo you will like it . \n",

       "  xxmaj also known under the slightly different tile xxmaj airport 1977 this second sequel to the smash - hit disaster thriller xxmaj airport ( 1970 ) was directed by xxmaj jerry xxmaj jameson & while once again like it 's predecessors i ca n't say xxmaj airport ' 77 is any sort of forgotten classic it is entertaining although not necessarily for the right reasons . xxmaj out of the three xxmaj airport films i have seen so far i actually liked this one the best , just . xxmaj it has my favourite plot of the three with a nice mid - air hi - jacking & then the crashing ( did n't he see the oil rig ? ) & sinking of the 747 ( maybe the makers were trying to cross the original xxmaj airport with another popular disaster flick of the period xxmaj the xxmaj poseidon xxmaj adventure ( 1972 ) ) & submerged is where it stays until the end with a stark dilemma facing those trapped inside , either suffocate when the air runs out or drown as the 747 floods or if any of the doors are opened & it 's a decent idea that could have made for a great little disaster flick but bad unsympathetic character 's , dull dialogue , lethargic set - pieces & a real lack of danger or suspense or tension means this is a missed opportunity . xxmaj while the rather sluggish plot keeps one entertained for 108 odd minutes not that much happens after the plane sinks & there 's not as much urgency as i thought there should have been . xxmaj even when the xxmaj navy become involved things do n't pick up that much with a few shots of huge ships & helicopters flying about but there 's just something lacking here . xxmaj george xxmaj kennedy as the jinxed airline worker xxmaj joe xxmaj patroni is back but only gets a couple of scenes & barely even says anything preferring to just look worried in the background . \n",

       "  xxmaj the home video & theatrical version of xxmaj airport ' 77 run 108 minutes while the xxup us xxup tv versions add an extra hour of footage including a new opening credits sequence , many more scenes with xxmaj george xxmaj kennedy as xxmaj patroni , flashbacks to flesh out character 's , longer rescue scenes & the discovery or another couple of dead bodies including the navigator . xxmaj while i would like to see this extra footage i am not sure i could sit through a near three hour cut of xxmaj airport ' 77 . xxmaj as expected the film has dated badly with horrible fashions & interior design choices , i will say no more other than the toy plane model effects are n't great either . xxmaj along with the other two xxmaj airport sequels this takes pride of place in the xxmaj razzie xxmaj award 's xxmaj hall of xxmaj shame although i can think of lots of worse films than this so i reckon that 's a little harsh . xxmaj the action scenes are a little dull unfortunately , the pace is slow & not much excitement or tension is generated which is a shame as i reckon this could have been a pretty good film if made properly . \n",

       "  xxmaj stay away from this crap and watch 48 hours 1 and 2 instead . xxmaj at lest they have characters you care about , a sense of humor and nothing but real actors in the cast .,xxbos xxmaj not even the xxmaj beatles could write songs everyone liked , and although xxmaj walter xxmaj hill is no mop - top he 's second to none when it comes to thought provoking action movies . xxmaj the nineties came and social platforms were changing in music and film , the emergence of the xxmaj rapper turned movie star was in full swing , the acting took a back seat to each man 's overpowering regional accent and transparent acting . xxmaj this was one of the many ice - t movies i saw as a kid and loved , only to watch them later and cringe . xxmaj bill xxmaj paxton and xxmaj william xxmaj sadler are firemen with basic lives until a burning building tenant about to go up in flames hands over a map with gold implications . i hand it to xxmaj walter for quickly and neatly setting up the main characters and location . xxmaj but i fault everyone involved for turning out xxmaj lame - o performances . xxmaj ice - t and cube must have been red hot at this time , and while i 've enjoyed both their careers as rappers , in my opinion they fell flat in this movie . xxmaj it 's about ninety minutes of one guy ridiculously turning his back on the other guy to the point you find yourself locked in multiple states of disbelief . xxmaj now this is a movie , its not a documentary so i wo nt waste my time recounting all the stupid plot twists in this movie , but there were many , and they led nowhere . i got the feeling watching this that everyone on set was xxunk of confused and just playing things off the cuff . xxmaj there are two things i still enjoy about it , one involves a scene with a needle and the other is xxmaj sadler 's huge 45 pistol . xxmaj bottom line this movie is like domino 's pizza . xxmaj yeah ill eat it if i 'm hungry and i do n't feel like cooking , xxmaj but i 'm well aware it tastes like crap . 3 stars , meh .,xxbos xxmaj brass pictures ( movies is not a fitting word for them ) really are somewhat brassy . xxmaj their alluring visual qualities are reminiscent of expensive high class xxup tv commercials . xxmaj but unfortunately xxmaj brass pictures are feature films with the pretense of wanting to entertain viewers for over two hours ! xxmaj in this they fail miserably , their undeniable , but rather soft and flabby than steamy , erotic qualities non withstanding . \n",

       "  xxmaj senso ' 45 is a remake of a film by xxmaj luchino xxmaj visconti with the same title and xxmaj alida xxmaj valli and xxmaj farley xxmaj granger in the lead . xxmaj the original tells a story of senseless love and lust in and around xxmaj venice during the xxmaj italian wars of independence . xxmaj brass moved the action from the 19th into the 20th century , 1945 to be exact , so there are xxmaj mussolini murals , men in black shirts , xxmaj german uniforms or the tattered garb of the partisans . xxmaj but it is just window dressing , the historic context is completely negligible . \n",
